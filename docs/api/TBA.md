This page is currently under construction but we can promise you following advantages XCM API will bring:
- Faster integration into your dApp
- Offload your dApp from heavy computing required to construct call
- No installation of any libraries required (This means you save space and headache with dependencies)

Expected release date is in **Q3 2023**.
