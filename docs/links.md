# This page contains links to Paraspell repositories and a basic overview

## XCM-SDK
[SDK Link](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-sdk)
SDK serves as `XCM`, `XCMP`, `Asset pallet`, `XYK pallet` enhancement to ease developers' life. Most of XCM support has to be researched before the developer can implement support into their dApp. This SDK makes it simple to implement. Developers no longer need to research anything. Just import and hack.
## UI-V1
[UI-V1 Link](https://github.com/paraspell/ui-v1) UI is the enhancement of `SDK` and allows Parachain developers to test their Parachains `locally`. It allows them to open HRMP channels between already preconfigured Parachans and also try `XCM` messages between them. UI also serves as an example of learning how `XCM` works in practice.
## UI-V2
[UI-V2 Link](https://github.com/paraspell/ui-v2) New version of UI mentioned above. It uses a Sub-scaffold template and state-of-the-art Vue3 and Nuxt to deliver maximum performance and utility. The design is also slightly more intuitive to use and more modern.
## Docs
[Docs Link](https://github.com/paraspell/docs) Docs are to demonstrate how SDK can be used. They also contain useful `links` and some information about `Paraspell`. We want to make usage of `SDK` and `UI` as simple as possible.

## Sub scaffold template
[Sub-scaffold Link](https://github.com/kodadot/sub-scaffold) Sub-scaffold is a template that Paraspell sponsored along the way. It is essentially a template that allows dApp developers to create new dApps on Substrate as quickly as possible. It contains preinstalled packages and useful modules for managing `logging in`, `asset decimals` and more. It also enhances Paraspell SDK.

## Moondo
[Moondo Link](https://github.com/paraspell/moondo) Moondo was created for the Moonbeam hackathon. It contains a simple example of `Axelar GMP` that can be launched locally. It also demonstrates `XCM` usability on `Test net`. Lastly, it uses a special pallet called `XCM Transactor` which allows the user to execute commands on the Relay chain from Parachain. Cool tech!

## Astarot
[Astarot Link](https://github.com/paraspell/astarot) Astarot was built in a hackathon for `Astar`. It contains `SDK` and is deployed to `Main net`. Users can use it to transfer `DOT/KSM` Between the Relay chain & Astar as well as transfer `ASTR/SDN` tokens from Astar.
