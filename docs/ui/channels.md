## Opening HRMP channels
First example will demonstrate how to open channel from Karura to Bifrost.

- Process is really simple. Just select origin and destination node and hit send. Once we receive notification about successful open of second channel we can go to close channel screen to check if our channels opened successfuly.

## Closing HRMP channels

We select channel from opened channels. If there are no channels opened head to open channel section and open them first. There are two channels open because communication in one channel can be only one way and is not bidirectional.
