# This section goes through HRMP channel examples in UI

### Make sure to install all prerequisites and launch the network first
You can find out how in [starting network section](https://paraspell.github.io/docs/ui/local.html).

## Opening HRMP channels
The first example will demonstrate how to open a channel from Karura to Bifrost.

- Process is really simple. Just select the origin and destination node and hit send. Once we receive a notification about the successful open of the second channel we can go to the close channel screen to check if our channels opened successfully.

## Closing HRMP channels

We select a channel from opened channels. If there are no channels opened head to the open channel section and open them first. There are two channels open because communication in one channel can be only one way and is not bidirectional.

After successful notification and resetting of screen we should not see any channels.
