## What we are working on 🧰
- [XCM API](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-api) (LightSpell⚡️): Meant to ease the integration of XCM interoperability into your dApp, offload your dApp from heavy computing and save you costs. LightSpell implements XCM SDK into simple API endpoints.
- [XCM SDK](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-sdk): Meant to unify cross-chain experience on Polkadot and become a layer 2 protocol that allows for seamless integration of XCM into your dApps. XCM SDK groups all 44 integrated XCM compatible Parachain XCM Pallets into one uniform package and allows you to generate cross-chain calls with just one line.

Complete guide on how to use these tools will be mentioned throughout the document.


## What is ParaSpell✨ in general

ParaSpell focuses on enhancing `XCM` functionality by doing research on every XCM compatible Parachain. Research is then composed into XCM API and XCM SDK repositories that group diversity in XCM into uniform easy to implement tools that allow you to implement interoperability benefits of Polkadot ecosystem into your application within moments.

**Why should I use ParaSpell✨?**

Implementing Polkadots flagship feature called XCM into your application could be a `complicated` matter sometimes. Parachains tend to customize their XCM Pallets to fit their needs which creates lots of diversity. This means, that implementing support for different Parachains in uniform way is lenghty task. Luckily, ParaSpell `wrapped` these pallets from every compatible Parachain and did this `research` for you. In the end, `saving time` can be essential when delivering a product. Time `never` stops, so we all should use it wisely.
