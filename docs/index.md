# What is ParaSpell✨

ParaSpell✨ focuses on enhancing `XCM` functionality along with `Assets` that the compatible Parachains implement, `XYK` pallet and `HRMP` pallet.

**Why should I use ParaSpell✨?**

Implementing XCM support into your dApp could be a `complicated` matter sometimes. Each Parachain can implement support for XCM their `own way`. ParaSpell✨ `wrapped` every compatible Parachain and did this `research` for you. In the end, `saving time` can be essential when delivering a product. Time `never` stops, so we all should use it wisely.

**ParaSpell✨ divides into three parts which will be mentioned in docs:**

- XCM API, this part is currently under construction and will provide much faster integration and response times when generating calls compared to manual integration of XCM SDK
- XCM SDK, you can easily construct `XCM` messages in a matter of seconds 
- UI for XCM SDK, playing with `local network` and for `Parachain developers` to test their work
