# What is ParaSpell‚ú®

ParaSpell‚ú® focuses on enhancing `XCM` functionality along with `Assets` that node implement, `XYK` pallet and `HRMP` pallet.

**Why should I use ParaSpell‚ú®?**

Implementing XCM support into your dApp could be `complicated` matter sometimes. Each node can implement support for XCM their `own way`. ParaSpell‚ú® `wraped` every compatible node and did this `research` for you. In the end, `saving time` can be essential when delivering a product. Time `never` stops, so we all should use it wisely.

**ParaSpell‚ú® divides into two parts which will be mentioned in docs:**

- XCM SDK, you can easily construct `XCM` messages in matter of seconds 
- UI for XCM SDK, playing with `local network` and for `parachain developers` to test their work
