We will explain how a new node can be added by explaining part of config file on one example node. <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55763425/186969086-f5875cb1-61d4-4d0b-89b1-e373b61fa515.png" alt="carbon (31)"> This example is for the Pichiu node. In order to avoid the same Parachain ID, it needs to be overridden to 2001 (default is 2000 which is same as Acala). Every node requires a docker image, base name and volume path. There can be standard flags included. Flags usually differ in purpose. Some are meant for the Relay chain and some for the node itself. In order to use node with API, we need to add wsPort and specify it to concrete value. Collators also have to be added for Parachain to produce blocks (Alice &amp; Bob in this case). More possible options for customization of network config can be found in the Parachain-launch repository <a href="https://github.com/open-web3-stack/parachain-launch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.</p><h2 id="adding-a-node-to-the-ui" tabindex="-1">Adding a node to the UI <a class="header-anchor" href="#adding-a-node-to-the-ui" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>There are five screens and areas that need to get updated when a new node is added.
